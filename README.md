This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started



First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Secondly, run the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Note: 

The .env with the links to the backend is already included in the zip file (submission), so it should connect.

The backend may take ~1 minute to boot up from sleep since we are on the Free tier of the hosting platform. As such, please wait for the results (especially when fetching wallets)
